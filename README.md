# Linux-journey
A sort of guide and documentation of my own journeys into linux
- This was made in hopes of helping fellow Koreans get into linux, so most documents will be in Korean.
- This doesn't mean I won't offer guides in English, as I will try and translate and localize into English as soon as I'm done with the Korean parts.
- This guide is a working process, because
  1. I need to carry over my notes to github
  2. I am still learning about linux. I am still a noob.
