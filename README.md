# Linux-journey
A sort of guide and documentation of my own journeys into linux
- This was made in hopes of helping fellow Koreans get into linux, so most documents will be in Korean.
- I also made this guide as like a compilation of other guides I saw online. So, yes, if one of these pages looks like an exact copy of your own guide you posted like years ago, then yeah, it's most likely from yours.
- This doesn't mean I won't offer guides in English, as I will try and translate and localize into English as soon as I'm done with the Korean parts.
- This guide is a working process, because
  1. I need to carry over my notes to github
  2. The contents of these guides are, well, not perfect, as my wording is not concise enough, making my instructions long and complicated than they need to be.
  3. I am still learning about linux. I am still a noob.
